Code base being developed to interface with the Udacity Unity3d Self-\/driving car simulator (available in my repo\+: \href{https://github.com/nikolaimatni/CppFun/tree/master/SelfDrivingCar}\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/nikolaimatni/\+Cpp\+Fun/tree/master/\+Self\+Driving\+Car}). For now we are working with the default \mbox{\hyperlink{classMPC}{M\+PC}} track (term 2, project 5), but we will ultimately customize.

The basic work flow here is you need to implement a realization of the virtual base class \mbox{\hyperlink{classModel}{Model}}\+: the pure virtual functions there are Cost, Terminal\+Cost and DynamicsF. This is pretty self-\/explanatory and further documented in the \mbox{\hyperlink{classModel}{Model}} page. Once this is specified, you initiate an \mbox{\hyperlink{classMPC}{M\+PC}} object with the suitable problem parameters and \mbox{\hyperlink{classModel}{Model}} in main.\+cpp and the rest of the code takes care of the low-\/level details of interfacing with Ip\+O\+PT and Cpp\+AD.

See \href{https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/}\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/udacity/\+Car\+N\+D-\/\+M\+P\+C-\/\+Project/} for the dependencies that you need to install to get this to run.
