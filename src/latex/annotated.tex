\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classBikeModel}{Bike\+Model}} \\*Implementation of simple bike model used for direct N\+LP. The cost function parameters were taken from someone\textquotesingle{}s solution online just to debug things, will tune them more substantially later }{\pageref{classBikeModel}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structBounds}{Bounds}} \\*Struct used to hold bounds for state constraints. Specifically, x\+\_\+low\+\_\+ $<$= x(t) $<$= x\+\_\+up\+\_\+, and u\+\_\+low\+\_\+ $<$= u(t) $<$= u\+\_\+low\+\_\+ for all t, where constraints are enforced element wise }{\pageref{structBounds}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classModel}{Model}} \\*Base \mbox{\hyperlink{classModel}{Model}} Class. Takes care of all of the low-\/level details needed to implement the cost function, dynamics. Derive from this class and override the pure virtual functions Cost(t,x(t),u(t),u(t+1)), Terminal\+Cost(x(\+N)), and DynamicsF(t,x(t),u(t)); }{\pageref{classModel}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classMPC}{M\+PC}} \\*Base \mbox{\hyperlink{classMPC}{M\+PC}} class. Whereas the model that you pass in takes care of specifying the dynamics and the cost function, the \mbox{\hyperlink{classMPC}{M\+PC}} object sets up the bounds on variables (as specified in \mbox{\hyperlink{structBounds}{Bounds}} object), and on constraints (enforces x(0) = x0, x(t+1) -\/ f(x(t),u(t)) = 0), and also warmstarts your solver with a suitably shifted version of the last run\textquotesingle{}s solution }{\pageref{classMPC}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classSeqLinMPC}{Seq\+Lin\+M\+PC}} \\*Place holder for what I\textquotesingle{}m working on now -- not clear if the sequential linearization implementation will require a modification to base \mbox{\hyperlink{classMPC}{M\+PC}} class, or will be fine with just a new model }{\pageref{classSeqLinMPC}}{}
